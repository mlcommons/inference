# MLPerfâ„¢ Inference Benchmark Suite
MLPerf Inference is a benchmark suite for measuring how fast systems can run models in a variety of deployment scenarios. 

Please see the [MLPerf Inference benchmark paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02549) for a detailed description of the benchmarks along with the motivation and guiding principles behind the benchmark suite. If you use any part of this benchmark (e.g., reference implementations, submissions, etc.), please cite the following:

## MLPerf Inference v3.1 (submission August 18, 2023)
Please use the master branch for v3.1 submission. You can use the latest commit or any commit since [f7df3acb6880b6b3a92cd5a444d173137aa5d8ca](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/tree/f7df3acb6880b6b3a92cd5a444d173137aa5d8ca) for doing the submission. v3.1 tag will be released once submissions are over for reproducibility. 

Those doing power submissions must use the `master` branch of the [MLCommons power-dev](https://github.com/mlcommons/power-dev) repository and checkout to [e9e16b1299ef61a2a5d8b9abf5d759309293c440](https://github.com/mlcommons/power-dev/tree/e9e16b1299ef61a2a5d8b9abf5d759309293c440).
