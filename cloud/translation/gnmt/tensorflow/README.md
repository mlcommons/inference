# 1. Problem
- This problem uses recurrent neural network to do language translation.
- The steps to train the model and generate the dataset are listed in [train_gnmt.txt](https://github.intel.com/Intel-MLPerf/inference/blob/master/gnmt/nmt/train_gnmt.txt). Basically, they follow the MLPerf training code. However, you can download the model and dataset with the scripts in this directory.

# 2. Directions

### Install Dependencies

GPU
```
pip install --user tensorflow-gpu
```

CPU
```
pip install --user tensorflow
```

### Run GNMT over full Dataset

- go to this folder
```
$ cd /path/to/gnmt/tensorflow/
```

- Change permission and download the pre-trained model and dataset by:

```
$ chmod +x ./download_trained_model.sh
$ ./download_trained_model.sh
$ chmod +x ./download_dataset.sh
$ ./download_dataset.sh
```

- verify the dataset

```
$ chmod +x ./verify_dataset.sh
$ ./verify_dataset.sh
```

- Evaluate performance with a specific batch size.
```
$ python run_task.py --run=performance --batch_size=32
```

- Evaluate accuracy to ensure the target BLEU.
```
$ python run_task.py --run=accuracy
```

### Run GNMT through LoadGen:
1.  Follow the instructions from https://github.com/mlperf/inference/blob/master/loadgen/README.md
2.  Run:
```
python loadgen_gnmt.py --store_translation
```

This will invoke the SingleStream scenario (default --scenario option) in Performance mode (default --mode option), and in addition, will store the output of every sentence in a separate file.

Other scenarios can be ran by changing the "--scenario" option. Accuracy tracking can be enabled with the "--mode Accuracy" option. Please run the following command for complete overview of options:
```
python loadgen_gnmt.py -h
```

# 3. Dataset

BLEU evaluation is done on newstest2014 from WMT16 English-German
