# What's New & What's Coming ðŸš€  

!!! info  
    **Inference v5.0 Submission** is approaching! The submission deadline is **February 28, 2025, at 1 PM PST**.  

!!! tip  
    Starting **January 2025**, MLPerf Inference automations are powered by **[MLCFlow](https://docs.mlcommons.org/mlcflow)**â€”a newly developed Python package that replaces the previously used **CMind** package. This transition enhances automation, streamlines workflows, and makes MLPerf scripts more independent and simpler.
