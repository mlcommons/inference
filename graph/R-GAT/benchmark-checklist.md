---

#### **7. Expected Accuracy and `accuracy.txt` Contents**
- [ ] Detailed expected accuracy and the required contents of the `accuracy.txt` file.

---

#### **8. Reference Model Details**
- [ ] Reference model details updated in [Inference benchmark docs](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/blob/docs/docs/index.md)  

---

#### **9. Reference Implementation Dataset Coverage**

  - [ ] Compliance runs  
- [ ] Valid log files passing the submission checker are generated for all runs.

---

#### **10. Test Runs with Smaller Input Sets**
- [X] Verified the reference implementation can perform test runs with a smaller subset of inputs for:
  - [X] Performance runs
  - [X] Accuracy runs

---

#### **11. Dataset and Reference Model Instructions**
- [X] Clear instructions provided for:
  - [X] Downloading the dataset and reference model.
  - [X] Using the dataset and model for the benchmark.

---

#### **12. Documentation of Recommended System Requirements to run the reference implementation**
- [X] Added [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/inference/blob/docs/docs/system_requirements.yml#L44)

---

#### **13. Submission Checker Modifications**
- [X] All necessary changes made to the **submission checker** to validate the benchmark.

---

#### **14. Sample Log Files**
- [ ] Include sample logs for all the applicable scenario runs:
  - [ ] `mlperf_log_summary.txt`
  - [ ] `mlperf_log_detail.txt`  
- [ ] Ensure sample logs successfully pass the submission checker and applicable compliance runs.
