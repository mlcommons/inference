# GPT-J Reference Implementation

Please see [this readme](README_cm.md) file for an automated way to run this benchmark out of the box and do an end-to-end submission with or without docker using the [MLCommons CM](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm) language.

### Setup Instructions

```bash
WORK_DIR=$PWD
# Create Environment (conda)
conda create -n llm python=3.9 -y
conda activate llm
conda install mkl mkl-include -y
conda install gperftools jemalloc==5.2.1 -c conda-forge -y

# install pytorch

```
### Build Loadgen
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlcommons/inference.git mlperf_inference
```

Build:

```sh
cd mlperf_inference/loadgen
CFLAGS="-std=c++14 -O3" python setup.py bdist_wheel
cd ..; pip install --force-reinstall loadgen/dist/`ls -r loadgen/dist/ | head -n1` ; cd -
cd ../..
```
### Clone 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mlcommons/inference.git
cd inference
cd language/gpt-j/
```


### Download & Process Dataset
Downloads the raw data, processes and saves it as json file inside data/
```
python download_cnndm.py
```

### Calibration
Downloads CNN-Daily Mail dataset and creates the calibration dataset (JSON) for post-training quantization
```
pip install datasets
python prepare-calibration.py --calibration-list-file calibration-list.txt --output-dir </path/to/output-folder>
```
### Download GPT-J model
Please download the fine-tuned GPT-J checkpoint from [here](https://cloud.mlcommons.org/index.php/s/QAZ2oM94MkFtbQx) and extract it as model/. The download_gptj.py only downloads the default huggingface model which is not fine-tuned on CNN-Daily mail dataset. 

MD5 hash of the zip file is `e677e28aaf03da84584bb3073b7ee315`. 

```
wget https://cloud.mlcommons.org/index.php/s/QAZ2oM94MkFtbQx/download --output-document checkpoint.zip
```

### Running the Benchmark
Replace the model and dataset path arguments with your corresponding paths. For evaluating the ROUGE score after the run, include --accuracy as shown below. For user specific target qps, please include user.conf.
```
python main.py --scenario=[Offline | Server | SingleStream] --model-path=./model/ --dataset-path=./data/cnn_eval.json [--accuracy] --max_examples=[Maximum number of examples to consider] [--gpu]
```
### Evaluate accuracy run 
Evaluates the ROGUE scores from the accuracy logs. Only applicable when specifying [--accuracy] while running main.py
```
python evaluation.py --mlperf-accuracy-file ./build/logs/mlperf_log_accuracy.json --dataset-file ./data/cnn_eval.json
```

### Reference Model - ROUGE scores
The following are the rouge scores obtained when evaluating the GPT-J fp32 model on the entire validation set (13368 samples) using beam search, beam_size=4

ROUGE 1 - 42.9865

ROUGE 2 - 20.1235

ROUGE L - 29.9881
