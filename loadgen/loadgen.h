/// \brief SUT calls this to notify loadgen of completed samples.
/// \details
/// * The samples may be from any combination of queries or partial queries as
///   issued by \link mlperf::SystemUnderTest::IssueQuery
///
///   SystemUnderTest::IssueQuery \endlink.
/// * The SUT is responsible for owning and allocating the reponse data. The
///   loadgen will copy the response data if needed (e.g. for accuracy mode).
///   + If no response callback is provided, the response data must remain valid
///     for the entire duration of this call.
///   + The response callback is untimed; it is called for each response in
///     responses after the loadgen records the completion time and before the
///     loadgen copies the response data. The response callback enables the
///     loadgen to simulate response data being stored in accelerator DRAM.
///     After the response callback is called, response data must reside on the
///     host so that the loadgen can copy it. Submitters must seek prior
///     approval to use this feature of loadgen (refer to
///     https://github.com/mlcommons/inference_policies/blob/master/inference_rules.adoc#5-load-generator).
/// * All calls to QuerySampleComplete are thread-safe and wait-free bounded.
///   + Any number of threads can call QuerySampleComplete simultaneously.
///   + Regardless of where any other thread stalls, the current thread will
///     finish QuerySampleComplete in a bounded number of cycles.
///   + Note: If a callback is provided, the SUT must ensure that the callback
///     is also thread-safe and wait-free bounded for the above to hold.
