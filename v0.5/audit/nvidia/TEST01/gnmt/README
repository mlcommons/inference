In the case where performance mode results differ from accuracy mode results,
which would automatically result in an objection being raised, the objection
can be overturned by evaluating the quality of the results in the two modes
and ensuring that accuracy is maintained.
create_accuracy_baseline.sh attempts to facilitate this by using the perf
mode results to create a baseline accuracy log from the accuracy mode results
that contains the same subset of the full dataset as the provided performance
mode log. This allows for an apples-to-apples comparison using the GNMT 
accuracy checking script provided in the MLPerf inference repository.
The scores should be reported to the result committee who will then review
and evalute whether the objection will be permitted to be overturned.

Note: You may see a python error about:
 module 'tensorflow' has no attribute 'gfile'
in which case, replace tf.gfile.GFile with tf.io.gfile.GFile in process_accuracy.py
Usage:
1) bash ./create_accuracy_baseline.sh <accuracy_accuracy_log_file> <perf_accuracy_log_file>
2) python inference/v0.5/translation/gnmt/tensorflow/process_accuracy.py \
        --accuracy_log <generated baseline> \
        --reference <GNMT dataset>/gnmt/newstest2014.tok.bpe.32000.de
3) python inference/v0.5/translation/gnmt/tensorflow/process_accuracy.py \
        --accuracy_log <perf_accuracy_log_file> \
        --reference <GNMT dataset>/gnmt/newstest2014.tok.bpe.32000.de
4) Upload accuracy logs and report BLEU scores
