The purpose of this test is to ensure that the SUT is not tuned for specific Loadgen RNG seed values.
The pass condition is that performance with non-default RNG seed values should be similar to the submitted
score.

The seeds that are changed are listed below:
  qsl_rng_seed - determines order of samples in QSL
  sample_index_rng_seed - determines subset of samples in each loadable set
  schedule_rng_seed - determines scheduling of samples in server mode

This test does not use custom dataset or weights.

Instructions

Part I
    Run test with provided audit.config in PerformanceOnly mode

Part II
    Ensure that performance with custom RNG seeds matches submission performance score.
  
  python verify_performance.py -r <submission mlperf_log_summary.txt> -t <this test's mlperf_log_summary.txt>

Expected outcome:
  TEST PASS
