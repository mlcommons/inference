### Disclaimer
This is a reference implementation of the benchmark that is not meant to be the fastest implementation possible.
The official model is the largest model on the order of 100GB, while interface to other models is only provided to facilitate debugging.

The reference implementation includes all required pre-processing of datasets.
It also includes ```--accuracy``` option to validate accuracy and ROC AUC (receiver operating characteritics area under the curve) metrics as required by MLPerf [1].

The reference implementation was tested on a machine with 256GB RAM and 8x32GB GPUs.

## Prerequisites and Installation
We support [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) and might add TensorFlow backend implementation.

The following steps are **only** needed if you run the benchmark **without Docker**.

Python 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 is supported and we recommend to use Anaconda.

Install the desired backend. For pytoch:
```
pip install torch torchvision
pip install scikit-learn
pip install numpy
pip install pydot
pip install torchviz
pip install protobuf
pip install tqdm
```

### Prepare the code and dataset
1. Download or clone the MLPerf [inference](https://github.com/mlperf/inference) and [trainining](https://github.com/mlperf/training) code
```
cd $HOME
mkdir ./mlperf && cd ./mlperf
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlperf/training.git
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mlperf/inference.git
export DLRM_DIR=$HOME/mlperf/training/recommendation/dlrm
```
2. Download pre-trained model weights (see links available above)
```
cd $HOME/mlperf/inference/v0.5/recommendation
mkdir ./model && cd ./model
mv <downloaded_file> dlrm_terabyte.pytorch
export MODEL_DIR=./model
```
3. Download corresponding Criteo dataset (see links available above)
```
cd $HOME/mlperf/inference/v0.5/recommendation
mkdir ./criteo && cd ./criteo
mv <downloaded_file(s)> ./
export DATA_DIR=./criteo
```
4. Build and install the loadgen
```
cd $HOME/mlperf/inference/loadgen
CFLAGS="-std=c++14" python setup.py develop --user
```

### More information about the datasets
| dataset | download link |
| ---- | ---- |
| Criteo Kaggle DAC | https://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/ |
| Criteo Terabyte   | https://labs.criteo.com/2013/12/download-terabyte-click-logs/ |

1. The Criteo Kaggle DAC dataset is composed of 7 days, which are stored in file: `train.txt`. This file is expected by the code.


2. The Criteo Terabyte dataset is stored in several files corresponding to 24 days: `day_0.gz, day_1.gz, ..., day_23.gz`. Please unzip all the files to obtain the text files `day_0, day_1, ..., day_23` expected by the code.
```
gunzip day_{0..23}.gz
```

3. The Criteo fake dataset can be created in place of the real datasets in order to facilitate debugging and testing. We provide a fake (random) data generator that can be used to quickly generate data samples in a format compatible with both original and mlperf binary loaders. Please use the following script in `./tools` to quickly create random samples for the corresponding models, which will be placed into `./fake_criteo` directory.
```
./make_fake_criteo.sh [kaggle|terabyte0875|terabyte]
mv ./fake_criteo .. && cd ..
export DATA_DIR=./fake_criteo
```

## Running the benchmark

Download and install all the pre-requisites. Both local and docker environment need to set 3 environment variables:
```
export DATA_DIR=YourCriteoTerabyteLocation
export MODEL_DIR=YourModelFileLocation
export DLRM_DIR=YourDLRMSourceLocation
```

### Run local
```
./run_local.sh backend model dataset device [options]

backend is one of [pytorch]
model is one of [dlrm]
dataset is one of [kaggle|terabyte]
device is one of [cpu|gpu]
options are extra arguments that are passed along
```

For example, to run on CPU you may choose to use:

1. Criteo Kaggle DAC
```
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm kaggle cpu --accuracy --scenario Offline
```

2. Criteo Terabyte (0.875)
```
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm terabyte cpu --accuracy --scenario Offline --max-ind-range=10000000 --data-sub-sample-rate=0.875 [--mlperf-bin-loader]
```
3. Criteo Terabyte
```
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm terabyte cpu --accuracy --scenario Offline  --max-ind-range=40000000 [--mlperf-bin-loader]
```
Note that the code support (i) original and (ii) mlperf binary loader, that have slightly different performance characteristics. The latter loader can be enabled by adding `--mlperf-bin-loader` to the command line.

Note that this script will pre-process the data during the first run and reuse it over sub-sequent runs. The pre-processing of data can take a significant amount of time during the first run.

In order to use GPU(s), select the number of GPUs with the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, and run
```
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm terabyte gpu --accuracy
```

### Get started quickly with Docker

Ensure you have a working docker setup on your machine.

#### CPU

Build Dockerfile configuration
```
cd $HOME/mlperf/inference/v0.5/recommendation
docker build -t dlrm-cpu docker_cpu/.
```

Run Docker container in interactive mode and enter the docker console
```
docker run -it dlrm-cpu
```
Inside container kickstart default setup (environment, git checkout, fake dataset and model download)
```
source kickstart.sh
```

#### GPU

Build Dockerfile configuration
```
cd $HOME/mlperf/inference/v0.5/recommendation
docker build -t dlrm-gpu docker_gpu/.
```

Run Docker container in interactive mode and enter the docker console
```
docker run --gpus all -it dlrm-gpu
```

Ensure you have a working docker setup with CUDA support (Should return True); If false ensure you have a functioning Docker installation with CUDA and GPU support.
```
python -c "exec(\"import torch\nprint(torch.cuda.is_available())\")"
```

Inside container kickstart default setup (environment, git checkout, fake dataset, model download and default to single GPU). See above for changing `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
```
source kickstart.sh
```

### Examples for testing
During development running the full benchmark is unpractical. Here are some options to help:

`--count-samples` limits the number of items in the dataset used for accuracy pass

`--duration` limits the time the benchmark runs

`--max-latency` the latency used for Server scenario

`--accuracy` enables accuracy pass

So if you want to tune for example Server scenario, try:
```
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm terabyte cpu --count-samples 100 --duration 60000 --scenario Server --target-qps 100 --max-latency 0.1

```

If you want run with accuracy pass, try:
```
./run_local.sh pytorch dlrm terabyte cpu --accuracy --duration 60000 --scenario Server --target-qps 100 --max-latency 0.2
```

`--config` the mlperf config file to use, defaults to v0.5/mlperf.conf

`--model` model name, i.e. dlrm

`--model-path MODEL_PATH` path to the file with model weights.

`--dataset` use the specified dataset. Currently we only support Criteo Terabyte.

`--dataset-path` path to the dataset.

`--scenario {SingleStream,MultiStream,Server,Offline}` benchmarking mode to be used.

`--profile {dlrm-kaggle-pytorch,dlrm-terabyte-pytorch}` this fills in default command line options with the once specified in the profile. Command line options that follow may override the those.

`--max-latency MAX_LATENCY` comma separated list of which latencies (in seconds) we try to reach in the 99 percentile (deault: 0.01,0.05,0.100).

`--samples-per-query` number of samples per query in MultiStream scenario.

`--samples-to-aggregate` number of samples to aggregate and treat as a single sample. This number will stay fixed during runs.

`--min-samples-to-aggregate, --max-samples-to-aggregate` number of samples to aggregate and treat as a single sample. This number will vary randomly between min and max during runs.

`--accuracy` perform inference on the entire dataset to validate achieved model accuracy/AUC metric.

`--find-peak-performance` determine the maximumum QPS for the Server and samples per query for the MultiStream, while not applicable to other scenarios.
